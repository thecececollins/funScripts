If you are ever needing to copy something quickly to your clipboard or even multiple items here is a great keyboard shortcut that works in Safari and Stickies!

Step 1: Highlight your text
Step 2: Then use command + shift + Y

This will automatically open stickies and place your highlighted text in a sticky note all at once! 

This is great for all of you Stickies lovers! Hope you enjoy!
