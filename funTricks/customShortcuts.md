Did you know you can create your very own keyboard shortcuts?!


Your Mac allows you to create a custom keyboard shortcut for any menu item in just about every application. To access and create these, check out keyboard shortcut manager in System Preferences. 

(System Preferences > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts > Application Shortcuts > +)


I find the “Merge All Windows” menu command in Safari to be particularly useful so above I assigned it a keyboard equivalent.
