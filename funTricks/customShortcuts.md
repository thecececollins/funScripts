### Did you know you can create your very own keyboard shortcuts?!


Your Mac allows you to create a custom keyboard shortcut for any menu item in just about every application. To access and create these, check out keyboard shortcut manager in System Preferences. 

- (System Preferences > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts > Application Shortcuts > +)


I find the “Merge All Windows” menu command in Safari to be particularly useful so above I assigned it a keyboard equivalent.


### Ever wanted to add shortcuts of your favorite tools to the toolbar of most of your applications such as Pages, Finder, etc?!

- Simply right click (or Control + click) on the toolbar and click Customize Toolbar… 
- Drag the icons of the shortcuts you would like to the toolbar, then click Done.

**This feature can be used in almost all Apple Programs (including Pages, Safari, Mail, and yes… even Finder) and most 3rd party programs (even TextExpander!).**


*You can revert back to the default setup anytime*
