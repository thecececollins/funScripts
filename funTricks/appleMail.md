Tired of “having” to forward/reply to EVERYTHING in an email just so the recipient can have one little section of it?

SOLUTION!
Highlight the portion of the email you want to forward or reply to.
Then click the forward or reply button.

You will notice that only the highlighted portion is placed in your new email! What?! Craziness!
